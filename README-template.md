## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In taking this challenge, I have been able to learn and understand quite a number of things regarding web development. Among these are:

- Using mixins and including a mixin in another mixin in SCSS. For instance,

```scss
@mixin flex {
  display: flex;
}

@mixin flexColumn {
  @include flex();
  flex-direction: column;
}

@mixin flexCenter {
  @include flex();
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

- Using mixin in CSS properties. Like this:

```scss
.badge {
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  background-color: var(--blue);
  color: var(--white);
  font-size: 1rem;
  height: 1.8rem;
  width: 2.5rem;
  @include flexCenter();
}
```

- Using local fonts in a project. This drastically reduces the amount of byte spent on reload as fonts are stored in client's local cache for reuse. This also enable font consistency among screens as to how the website is designed.

- Using multiple properties in transition. As in my code:

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

I am looking deeper to understanding the implementations of functions in SCSS and loops. This will definitely be an interesting dive and ease developement processs to deliver faster and better.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
